# Example for [AStruct] v6.0

The file took 3 days to implement, so please ignore any code optimization issues.

Please focus on:
1. **AList parsing of [SuperArray] and usage of [AStruct] itself**
2. **Focus on the trigger storage part:**
   This mainly demonstrates [AList]'s ability to reconstruct all QT6 widgets content and then store it.
3. **Focus on tablewidget initialization:**
   This showcases the integrated usage of [AList], [AStruct], and QT6 views.

Many parts utilize parsing of [SuperArray] with AList.
