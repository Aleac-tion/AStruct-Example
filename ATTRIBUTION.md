1) Documentation (README, whitepapers, guides, images, charts): licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). When redistributing or republishing documentation, you MUST provide attribution in the following form:

English example:

2) Code (example source files): licensed under the MIT License. The MIT License requires that the copyright notice and license text be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. In addition to the MIT requirements, please also include the attribution line above when redistributing examples or including them in published articles or guides.

3) Why a separate attribution file?
This file provides a clear, human-readable statement of how the author prefers to be attributed. The legal licenses (MIT and CC BY 4.0) remain the authoritative terms; this file is a practical guide to attribution that should be followed by downstream users.

If you are unsure how to attribute or have special use cases, you may contact the author via their GitHub profile: https://github.com/Aleac-tion

Note: Do not modify README.md per user instruction; do not prepend license block. Only create/overwrite the three files above.
